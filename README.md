## Welcome

Hi, I am Simon311 and historically I've mostly been working on TShock for Terraria plugins, although that direction is almost non-existent these days.

I know C# on a decent level and also have so experience with PHP and JS.

I have recently moved from Russia to Kazakhstan due to some recent events and personal safety concerns. 

If you like my past or present work, consider supporting me! â€” https://www.buymeacoffee.com/simon311
